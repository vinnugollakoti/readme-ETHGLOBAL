## ✨ Short Description  
Observability layer that reads wallet footprints to block spam and enrich agent interactions.

## 📖 Long Description  
**Contexto** is an observability layer for **Hedera agents** that reads wallet footprints across the chain, filters spam wallets, and enriches context for better interactions.  

Each wallet leaves behind valuable signals:  
- Age  
- Transaction history  
- Token diversity  
- dApp usage  
- Activity patterns  

Our system processes these footprints into **wallet profiles** with scores like:  
- **Spam likelihood**  
- **Engagement level**  
- **Loyalty**  
- **Whale value**  

Agents use these insights to **block junk wallets, focus on real users, and personalize responses**. Developers gain **dashboards** with:  
- Wallet clusters  
- Risk scores  
- Behavior heatmaps  

👉 The result: **safer, smarter, and more profitable agent–wallet interactions** powered by transparency, trust, and actionable intelligence.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Wallet Input** → User shares wallet details when onboarding.  
2. **Footprint Extraction** → Read on-chain signals (age, txns, tokens, dApps, patterns).  
3. **Profiling Engine** → Convert signals into scores (spam, loyalty, whale value).  
4. **Context Delivery** → Provide scores + insights to agents in real-time.  
5. **Developer Dashboard** → Visualize clusters, risks, and heatmaps for decision-making.
