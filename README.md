# Contexto

### Short Description  
Observability layer reading wallet footprints cross-chain to block spam & enhance AI agent interactions.

---

## 🚀 Long Description  
**Contexto** is an observability layer designed to empower AI agents with *context-aware intelligence*.  

When a user onboards into an application, we request their wallet details. Using those details, we trace and analyze wallet footprints across multiple chains. The data collected is processed into a **meaningful profile** that categorizes wallets into insights such as:  
- Good or bad actor  
- Spammer or not  
- Old or new wallet  
- Trustable or risky  

This **context** is then passed to AI agents, enabling them to understand **who they are interacting with**.  

- If the wallet is suspicious → AI agents can **restrict resources or interactions**.  
- If the wallet is legitimate → AI agents can **provide seamless and enriched services**.  

The result is **smarter, safer, and more responsible AI agent interactions**, aligned with Web3 values of transparency and trust.

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Cross-chain Wallet Observability** → Trace and analyze footprints across multiple chains.  
- **Spam & Risk Detection** → Identify malicious or spammy wallets before agents engage.  
- **AI Context Layer** → Provide AI agents with actionable insights into user identity.  
- **Voice-to-Voice Translation with Hedera Agent** → Enable real-time multilingual communication, powered by Hedera.  
- **Graph Protocol Integration** → Efficiently index and query wallet activity at scale.  
- **Agent Resource Control** → Dynamically adapt AI agent behavior based on wallet profile.

## 🔧 Technical Description  

### Hedera  
- **Voice-to-Voice Translation**: Integrated with the **Hedera Agent** to provide low-latency, cost-efficient translation services.  
- Uses Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for secure message passing between AI agents.  
- Ensures fairness, transparency, and verifiability of agent-to-agent communication.  
- Example: A French-speaking wallet holder interacts with an English-speaking agent seamlessly through Hedera-powered voice translation.  

### Graph Protocol  
- **Cross-Chain Data Indexing**: Leveraging The Graph to fetch wallet data (transactions, contracts, history) efficiently.  
- Subgraphs help in categorizing wallets → spammer, risky, or trustable.  
- Provides **real-time, queryable data** for AI agents to consume.  
- Ensures scalable observability without bottlenecks.
